Let me ask you a question about the difference between calculate_bigram_probabilities() for japanese vs (russian or finnish) functions?

I don't understand why japanese ones use tokenizers - would it be better if others did, too?

The results for perplexity metric for japanese is absurd (10e18 range, while finnish and russian is at solid 1k-5k)
```
Answer:
```
The notebook begins with importing modules (including janome and nltk) and setting reproducibility parameters, followed by dataset loading. For language-specific bigram probabilities, it defines tokenization approaches that diverge based on language. Specifically:

Finnish uses nltk.word_tokenize, separating words directly.
Russian likely uses a similar direct tokenization approach (though the exact function hasnâ€™t appeared in these initial lines).
Japanese requires a unique setup: it imports janome and leverages its Tokenizer class, indicating a dependency on specialized tokenization for segmentation of Japanese text.
I'll locate and review the calculate_bigram_probabilities function definitions for these languages to address your question about using tokenizers across languages and to understand the perplexity disparity you observed.

Yeah, these are the metrics for Naive Bayes classifier and the much more complex bidirectional LSTM model.
The BiLSTM outperforms the NB model in every category but the recall one - I am trying to understand why is it so.

Ah, now I see the specific table you're referring to! This appears to be from a paper about answerability detection across different languages (Finnish, Japanese, and Russian).

Looking at the metrics:
1. Naive Bayes (NB) consistently has 1.0 (100%) recall across languages
2. BiLSTM has slightly lower recall but better precision and overall accuracy

This pattern makes sense because:

1. NB's Perfect Recall Explanation:
- As a generative model, NB assigns every question to either "answerable" or "not answerable"
- It's likely being very "optimistic" and classifying most questions as answerable
- This means it catches all truly answerable questions (perfect recall)
- But it probably also incorrectly classifies some unanswerable questions as answerable (lower precision)

2. BiLSTM's Better Overall Performance:
- While it misses a few answerable questions (slightly lower recall)
- It's much more precise in its predictions
- This leads to better F1 scores and accuracy
- It's making more balanced decisions rather than being overly optimistic

The key insight is that NB's perfect recall might actually be a weakness here - it's achieving it by being too liberal in classifying questions as answerable, while the BiLSTM is making more nuanced, accurate decisions overall, even if it occasionally misses some answerable questions.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this analysis?
